A long time ago, when I was still cool, I was having break at a skatepark. Sitting in the shadow smoking a cigarette a little boy approached me. He was maybe ten years old. He stretched out his arm and showed me the hazelnut he was holding in his hand.
"You can eat these. They are tasty!" He said to me.
"Do you know what these are?" I asked. He shook his head. "These are the children of the trees. They let the fall to the floor where they grow into new trees!" I stated in an educational manner.
He looked at me for a second or two then threw the nut to the floor while saying loudly, "Ugh, I'll never eat these again!".
